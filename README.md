# Burger_Logger
App that lets the user input names of burgers they'd like to eat.  Whatever burger they submit will appear on the left side of the page, and there will be the option to devour it, which will remove the burger from the page.  This is accomplished by using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, and an ORM.
